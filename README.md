This project is licensed under the **Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)**.

### Important Clarification for Artists and Creators:

The CC BY-NC-SA license applies **only to the player's source code** (the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that make it run).

It **does not apply to the content you create**, such as your music, cover art, lyrics, or the `.jsonld` graph file that structures your narrative. You retain full ownership of your art and are free to license or sell it however you wish.

You can freely use this player as a non-commercial tool to display and distribute your commercial or non-commercial artwork.

### A Note on Attribution (How to give credit)

To comply with the license, you must provide a visible credit. We've made this as painless as possible.

**1. Required Attribution Text:**
You must include the following text somewhere visible (e.g., in the footer of your page or on an "About" page):

> **AVN Player by Nftxv**

**2. Required License Notice:**
You must also include a reference to the license, so others know the terms under which the player is shared.

**The Easiest Way to Do Both:**
You can fulfill both requirements with a single, simple line. Here is a perfect example:

*   `My Interactive Album (powered by AVN Player by Nftxv, used under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)`

*Or, with a link (even better):*

*   `My Interactive Album (powered by AVN Player by Nftxv, used under`
    `[CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/))`

This simple credit line is all that's needed.
